The project should be put inside a folder named "pyla"!

The project has around 45 class based views
9 models
5+ class based forms that have custom code in them
49 templates (around 40 of them are actually used)
Currently writing tests for each app.
There are different apps for:
- managing users (registering, logging, profile crud)
- user activity (posts inside forums, feedback, comments etc)
- forums (forums app, containts forums, posts, comments)
- subscriptions (takes care of subscription creations, ordering, editing)
Documentation for the other apps is to be expected
